Leveraged SVM regression technique in R to predict daily ridership
## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to device a robust methodology to improve daily ridership prediction at the Nickelodeon Universe. Ridership is defined as the number of total valid scans. Can apply to a single ticket, a single ride, or an aggregate, depending on context. For example, if the total valid scans for all rides on a single day was 25,000, we would say that ridership for that day was 25,000.
